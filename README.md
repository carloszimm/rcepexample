# Reactive CEP Example

This is a web example that aims to demonstrate some operations implemented by the Reactive CEP project. 

## Requirements
 - Internet connection (most JS plugins are accessed via CDN)
 - Browser with JavaScript ECMA 2015 (ES6) support
 - Node.js (server-side) v.8 or higher

## Running
To use the application, you must open the client html file in a browser.
Also, you must run the server. Before that, the following command must be executed in a terminal to install all the server-side required modules (inside the folder project):
> npm install

The above command must be run only once.
To run the server, execute the following (inside the folder project as well):
> node server

You can either run the command above before or after accessing the client html file.
